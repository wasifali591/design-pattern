## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide a template for solving certain issues and promote best practices for building maintainable and scalable software systems.

This repository serves as a collection of design pattern examples implemented in Java, along with explanations and usage guidelines.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

- **Factory Method**:
  A creational pattern that defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
  
- **Singleton Pattern**:
  Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

- **Builder Pattern**:
  A creational pattern used to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

### Structural Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**:
  A structural pattern that allows objects to be created with their dependencies supplied from the outside. It promotes loose coupling and testability.

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**:
  A structural pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic).

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Service Registry**:
  A behavioral pattern used in microservices architecture for dynamically discovering and communicating with services without hardcoding endpoints.

- **API Gateway**:
  A behavioral pattern that serves as a single entry point for clients to access multiple microservices. It handles tasks like routing, authentication, and load balancing.

- **Circuit Breaker**:
  A behavioral pattern that prevents cascading failures in a distributed system by temporarily blocking requests to a failing service.

- **Saga Pattern**:
  A behavioral pattern used to manage long-lived transactions across multiple services by breaking them into a series of smaller, independent steps.

- **Bulkhead Pattern**:
  A behavioral pattern that isolates failures in one part of the system from affecting others by partitioning resources.

- **Saga Choreography**:
  A behavioral pattern where each service publishes events to trigger subsequent steps in a transaction, promoting decentralization.

- **Template Method**:
  A behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

- **Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern**:
  A behavioral pattern that abstracts data access logic from business logic, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.

## Usage

To use the examples in this repository, simply navigate to the directory of the pattern you're interested in. Each directory contains a Java file demonstrating the implementation of the pattern along with a README file explaining the pattern and its usage.

Feel free to clone or download this repository to explore the examples locally on your machine.
