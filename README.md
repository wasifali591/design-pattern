## Introduction
This repository contains examples and implementations of various design patterns in Java.

## What is a Design Pattern?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide a template for solving certain issues and promote best practices for building maintainable and scalable software systems.

## Benefits of Design Patterns
- **Reusability:** Design patterns encapsulate proven solutions that can be reused across projects.
- **Scalability:** They help design systems that can scale efficiently as requirements evolve.
- **Maintainability:** Design patterns promote clean, modular, and maintainable code.
- **Flexibility:** They offer flexibility in design, allowing developers to adapt to changing requirements easily.
- **Standardization:** Patterns establish a common design vocabulary and best practices, facilitating communication and collaboration among developers.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- **Factory Method:** A creational pattern that defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
  - **Usage:** Often used in frameworks like Spring for creating beans.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
  - **Usage:** Commonly used in database connections, logging, and caching mechanisms.
- **Builder Pattern:** A creational pattern used to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
  - **Usage:** Frequently used in creating immutable objects, such as StringBuilder in Java.

### Structural Patterns
- **Dependency Injection:** A structural pattern that allows objects to be created with their dependencies supplied from the outside. It promotes loose coupling and testability.
  - **Usage:** Widely used in frameworks like Spring for managing bean dependencies.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** A structural pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic).
  - **Usage:** Commonly used in web applications, such as Spring MVC in Spring Boot.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Service Registry:** A behavioral pattern used in microservices architecture for dynamically discovering and communicating with services without hardcoding endpoints.
  - **Usage:** Utilized in service discovery platforms like Netflix Eureka.
- **API Gateway:** A behavioral pattern that serves as a single entry point for clients to access multiple microservices. It handles tasks like routing, authentication, and load balancing.
  - **Usage:** Often used in microservices architecture, such as Zuul in Spring Cloud.
- **Circuit Breaker:** A behavioral pattern that prevents cascading failures in a distributed system by temporarily blocking requests to a failing service.
  - **Usage:** Implemented in libraries like Hystrix, commonly used in microservices architecture.
- **Saga Pattern:** A behavioral pattern used to manage long-lived transactions across multiple services by breaking them into a series of smaller, independent steps.
  - **Usage:** Employed in distributed transaction management systems.
- **Bulkhead Pattern:** A behavioral pattern that isolates failures in one part of the system from affecting others by partitioning resources.
  - **Usage:** Commonly used in designing resilient and fault-tolerant systems.

## Usage
To use the examples in this repository, simply navigate to the directory of the pattern you're interested in. Each directory contains a Java file demonstrating the implementation of the pattern along with a README file explaining the pattern and its usage.
